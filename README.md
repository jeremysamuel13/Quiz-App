# Quiz App

A simple trivia app written in Flutter.

(Created as a project for a Udemy web course on Flutter)

## Features that I have added myself and were not included in the web course: 
- Uses [opentdb](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) to fetch random true/false trivia questions.
- Checks for web connectivity
